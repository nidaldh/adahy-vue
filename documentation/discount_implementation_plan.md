# Customer-Level Discount Implementation Plan

## Overview
Add customer-level fixed discount functionality that applies to the customer's total balance. Discounts will be tracked at the customer level and affect the final balance calculations.

**Implementation Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Last Updated**: 2025-06-01

## Requirements Summary
- **Discount Type**: Fixed amount only (in NIS)
- **Discount Level**: Customer level (not individual payments or animals)
- **Storage**: Stored with customer data
- **Impact**: Affects customer's total balance calculation

---

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure ✅ **COMPLETE**

### 1.1 Data Structure Changes

#### Customer Interface Updates
**File**: `src/store/modules/customers.ts`
```typescript
export interface Customer {
  // ...existing fields...
  discount?: {
    amount: number; // fixed discount amount in NIS
    reason?: string; // optional reason for discount
    appliedBy?: string; // user who applied the discount (future enhancement)
    appliedAt?: number; // timestamp when discount was applied
  };
  totalAmountBeforeDiscount: number; // original total before discount
  finalTotalAmount: number; // total after discount (used for balance calculation)
}
```

#### Balance Calculation Updates
- `balance = finalTotalAmount - totalPaidNIS` (instead of `totalAmount - totalPaidNIS`)
- Keep original `totalAmount` for reference but use `finalTotalAmount` for actual calculations

### 1.2 Discount Calculation Utils
**File**: `src/utils/customerDiscounts.ts`
```typescript
export interface CustomerDiscount {
  amount: number;
  reason?: string;
  appliedBy?: string;
  appliedAt?: number;
}

export function applyCustomerDiscount(
  totalAmount: number, 
  discountAmount: number
): {
  finalTotalAmount: number;
  discountApplied: number;
}

export function validateDiscountAmount(
  discountAmount: number,
  totalAmount: number
): boolean

export function calculateCustomerBalance(
  finalTotalAmount: number,
  totalPaidNIS: number
): number
```

```json
"discount": {
  "amount": {
    ".validate": "newData.isNumber() && newData.val() >= 0"
  },
  "reason": {
    ".validate": "newData.isString()"
  },
  "appliedAt": {
    ".validate": "newData.isNumber()"
  }
},
"totalAmountBeforeDiscount": {

  ".validate": "newData.isNumber() && newData.val() >= 0"
}
```

**Tasks:**

- [x] Test rule validation
- [x] Update documentation with new schema

---

## Phase 5: UI Enhancements ✅ **COMPLETE**

### 5.1 Customer List/Management Views

- Add discount indicator in customer cards (already done in CustomerCard.vue in Phase 2)

- ~~Filter/search by discounted customers in `CustomerList.vue`.~~ (Reverted as per user request)
- Show discount amounts in customer summaries (covered by `CustomerCard.vue`).

### 5.2 Payment History Updates

**File**: `src/components/payment/PaymentHistory.vue`

- Show customer discount information for context in the customer filter dropdown.
- Display customer discount amount and reason (if available) under the customer name in the payment history table.

- [x] Recalculate all customer balances based on `finalTotalAmount`

### 6.2 Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for discount calculation functions (Skipped as per user request)
- Integration tests for customer creation/update with discounts (Skipped as per user request)

## Business Rules and Constraints

### Discount Constraints

- Discount cannot exceed total amount from animals
- Discount must be positive number
- Optional business rule: maximum discount amount or percentage of total

### Balance Impact

- Customer balance = `finalTotalAmount - totalPaidNIS`
- Existing payments remain unchanged
- Future payments calculated against new balance

### Audit Trail

- Track when discount was applied (`appliedAt`)
- Optional: track who applied discount (`appliedBy`)
- Optional reason for discount (`reason`)

---

## Key Benefits

1. **Simplicity**: Single discount per customer, easy to understand and manage
2. **Flexibility**: Can be applied at any time, affects overall customer balance
3. **Audit Trail**: Clear tracking of who gets discounts and why
4. **Business Logic**: Maintains payment integrity while providing pricing flexibility
5. **Reporting**: Easy to track total discounts given and their business impact
